Move to the first logger folder, where you will see a Pom file.
Here, you run:

mvn clean install

which should create a jar file that is executable. 
Then, you should move to the target folder,
where you run:

java -jar logger.jar (NOT logger-1.jar)

Now it is subscribed and is ready to recieve data!
